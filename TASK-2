PROCEDURE:
I have selected an email from CYINT technologies as a sample for my task.
I have checked the emails header for spoofing (a deceptive practice where a person or program disguises their identity to appear as someone or something else, often to gain unauthorized access or trick victims into revealing sensitive information).
I copied the header of the email from the original text and verified it through MXTOOLBOX tool for discrepancies.
It had a suspicious link attached to it which could have asked my personal credentials.
After checking the header I copied the ip address of the mail and searched it in blacklist of mxtoolbox. 
I didnâ€™t find any spelling or grammar mistakes in the mail.
I confirmed it as a spam mail after analysing the header and verifying the ip address.
